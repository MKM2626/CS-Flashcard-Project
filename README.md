This is a python coding project I had to do in high school. Basically it allows you to create different subjects, that have different flashcard sets, with flashcards that contain a name and a term. These flash card sets can then be studied in various ways, by just going through the flashcards, fillingin in the blanks, doing a test, creating notes (just prints out a text file with the flashcard terms in alphabetical order), match up the flash cards, do a multi choice test, or edit any individual flashcards.
